# Madlibs in Flask

This is a simple Madlibs app built in Flask originally as part of the Rithm
School r30 cohort.

I'm currently working on ehanching this project to leverage Open AI's GPT APIs
to create inifinitely unique mad libs options, and in the process, learning how
to work with AI developer tools.

## TODO

- [ ] Clean up UI
- [ ] Distinguish and properly code "unique" words generated by AI
- [ ] Allow users to prompt the AI with topics for mad libs stories
- [ ] Allow saving / publishing of best stories.
- [ ] Visual indication of which words were "mad libs" words
- [ ] Allow users to edit individual words once story has been created
- [ ] Publish / share mad libs (signed out)
- [ ] Publish / share mad libs (signed in)
- [ ] Super lightweight user account management for saving libs
